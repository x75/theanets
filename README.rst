============
``THEANETS``
============

The ``theanets`` package is a deep learning and neural network toolkit. It is
written in Python to interoperate with excellent tools like ``numpy`` and
``scikit-learn``, and it uses Theano_ to accelerate computations when possible
using your GPU. The package aims to provide:

- a simple API for building and training common types of neural network models;
- thorough documentation;
- easy-to-read code;
- and, under the hood, a fully expressive graph computation framework.

The package strives to "make the easy things easy and the difficult things
possible." Please try it out, and let us know what you think!

Installation
============

Install the latest published code using pip::

    pip install theanets

Or download the current source and run it from there::

    git clone http://github.com/lmjohns3/theanets
    cd theanets
    python setup.py develop

Note that the contents of this README are linked to the version of ``theanets``
that you are using. If you're looking at the `README on GitHub`_, you'll need
the current GitHub code; if you're looking at the `README for a pypi release`_,
you'll need the code associated with that release.

Quick Start: Classification
===========================

Suppose you want to create a classifier and train it on some 100-dimensional
data points that you've classified into 10 categories. No problem! With just a
few lines you can (a) provide some data, (b) build and (c) train a model,
and (d) evaluate the model:

.. code:: python

  import climate
  import theanets
  from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
  from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

  climate.enable_default_logging()

  # Create a classification dataset.
  X, y = make_classification(
      n_samples=3000, n_features=100, n_classes=10, n_informative=10)
  X = X.astype('f')
  y = y.astype('i')
  cut = int(len(X) * 0.8)  # training / validation split
  train = X[:cut], y[:cut]
  valid = X[cut:], y[cut:]

  # Build a classifier model with 100 inputs and 10 outputs.
  net = theanets.Classifier(layers=[100, 10])

  # Train the model using SGD with momentum.
  net.train(train, valid, algo='sgd', learning_rate=1e-4, momentum=0.9)

  # Show confusion matrices on the training/validation splits.
  for label, (X, y) in (('training:', train), ('validation:', valid)):
      print(label)
      print(confusion_matrix(y, net.predict(X)))

Layers
------

The model above is quite simplistic! Make it a bit more sophisticated by adding
a hidden layer:

.. code:: python

  net = theanets.Classifier([100, 1000, 10])

In fact, you can just as easily create 3 (or any number of) hidden layers:

.. code:: python

  net = theanets.Classifier([100, 1000, 1000, 1000, 10])

By default, hidden layers use the relu transfer function. By passing a tuple
instead of just an integer, you can change some of these layers to use different
activations_:

.. code:: python

  maxout = (1000, 'maxout:4')  # maxout with 4 pieces.
  net = theanets.Classifier([
      100, 1000, maxout, (1000, 'tanh'), 10])

.. _activations: http://theanets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/activations.html

By passing a dictionary instead, you can specify even more attributes of each
layer_, like how its parameters are initialized:

.. code:: python

  # Sparsely-initialized layer with large nonzero weights.
  foo = dict(name='foo', size=1000, std=1, sparsity=0.9)
  net = theanets.Classifier([
      100, foo, (1000, 'maxout:4'), (1000, 'tanh'), 10])

.. _layer: http://theanets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/layers.html

Specifying layers is the heart of building models in ``theanets``. Read more
about this in `Specifying Layers`_.

.. _Specifying Layers: http://localhost:8080/guide.html#guide-creating-specifying-layers

Regularization
--------------

Adding regularizers is easy, too! Just pass them to the training method. For
instance, you can train up a sparse classification model with weight decay:

.. code:: python

  # Penalize hidden-unit activity (L1 norm) and weights (L2 norm).
  net.train(train, valid, hidden_l1=0.001, weight_l2=0.001)

In ``theanets`` dropout is treated as a regularizer and can be set on many
layers at once:

.. code:: python

  net.train(train, valid, hidden_dropout=0.5)

or just on a specific layer:

.. code:: python

  net.train(train, valid, dropout={'foo:out': 0.5})

Similarly, you can add Gaussian noise to any of the layers (here, just to the
input layer):

.. code:: python

  net.train(train, valid, input_noise=0.3)

Optimization Algorithms
-----------------------

You can optimize your model using any of the algorithms provided by downhill_
(SGD, NAG, RMSProp, ADADELTA, etc.), or additionally using a couple of
`pretraining methods`_ specific to neural networks.

.. _downhill: http://downhill.readthedocs.org/
.. _pretraining methods: http://theanets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/trainers.html

You can also make as many successive calls to train() as you like. Each call can
include different training algorithms:

.. code:: python

  net.train(train, valid, algo='rmsprop')
  net.train(train, valid, algo='nag')

different learning hyperparameters:

.. code:: python

  net.train(train, valid, algo='rmsprop', learning_rate=0.1)
  net.train(train, valid, algo='rmsprop', learning_rate=0.01)

and different regularization hyperparameters:

.. code:: python

  net.train(train, valid, input_noise=0.7)
  net.train(train, valid, input_noise=0.3)

Training models is a bit more art than science, but ``theanets`` tries to make
it easy to evaluate different training approaches. Read more about this in
`Training a Model`_.

Quick Start: Recurrent Models
=============================

Recurrent neural networks are becoming quite important for many sequence-based
tasks in machine learning; one popular toy example for recurrent models is to
generate text that's similar to some body of training text.

In these models, a recurrent classifier is set up to predict the identity of the
next character in a sequence of text, given all of the preceding characters. The
inputs to the model are the one-hot encodings of a sequence of characters from
the text, and the corresponding outputs are the class labels of the subsequent
character. The ``theanets`` code has a Text_ helper class that provides easy
encoding and decoding of text to and from integer classes; using the helper
makes the top-level code look like:

.. code:: python

  import numpy as np, re, theanets

  chars = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', open('corpus.txt').read().lower())
  txt = theanets.recurrent.Text(chars, min_count=10)
  A = 1 + len(txt.alpha)  # of letter classes

  # create a model to train: input -> gru -> relu -> softmax.
  net = theanets.recurrent.Classifier([A, (100, 'gru'), (1000, 'relu'), A])

  # train the model iteratively; draw a sample after every epoch.
  seed = txt.encode(txt.text[300017:300050])
  for tm, _ in net.itertrain(txt.classifier_batches(100, 32), momentum=0.9):
      print('{}|{} ({:.1f}%)'.format(
          txt.decode(seed),
          txt.decode(net.predict_sequence(seed, 40)),
          100 * tm['acc']))

This example uses several features of ``theanets`` that make modeling neural
networks fun and interesting. The model uses a layer of `Gated Recurrent Units`_
to capture the temporal dependencies in the data. It also `uses a callable`_ to
provide data to the model, and takes advantage of `iterative training`_ to
sample an output from the model after each training epoch.

.. _Text: http://theanets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/generated/theanets.recurrent.Text.html
.. _Gated Recurrent Units: http://theanets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/generated/theanets.layers.recurrent.GRU.html
.. _uses a callable: http://downhill.readthedocs.org/en/stable/guide.html#data-using-callables
.. _iterative training: http://downhill.readthedocs.org/en/stable/guide.html#iterative-optimization

To run this example, download a text you'd like to model (e.g., Herman
Melville's *Moby Dick*) and save it in ``corpus.txt``::

  curl http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt > corpus.txt

Then when you run the script, the output might look something like this
(abbreviated to show patterns)::

Here, the seed text is shown left of the pipe character, and the randomly
sampled sequence follows. In parantheses are the per-character accuracy values
on the training set while training the model. The pattern of learning proceeds
from almost-random character generation, to producing groups of letters
separated by spaces, to generating words that seem like they might belong in
*Moby Dick*, things like "captain," "ahab, too," and "constantly used the coil."

Much amusement can be derived from a temporal model extending itself forward in
this way. After all, how else would we ever think of "Pequodeers,"
"Starbuckably," or "Ginqueg"?!
